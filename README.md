# DDoSAttackDetection
Did this as a team project for Data Science-III Course at IIT Mandi (3rd Semester)

- The project aimed to differentiate DDoS Attacks from legitimate requests based on features such as packet-size, packet-rate, tx-bytes, protocol etc.
- Did some preprocessing and ran models such as Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM.
- Also attempted Feature Selection and compared results of different models with and without feature selection.
